Module 19 Challenge  
*Elizabeth Cooney* ***10/8/24***

## Overview
>You are tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so you are also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.
